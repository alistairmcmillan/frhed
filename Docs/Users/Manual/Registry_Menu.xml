  <title>The <guimenu>Registry</guimenu> Menu</title>

  <para>The <guimenu>Registry</guimenu> menu contains items related to methods
  of launching Frhed, the registry data, relations with previous versions of
  Frhed and different instances of Frhed.</para>

  <para>Of course if you are a power user you will probably prefer to do all
  of the below yourself.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Save ini when required</title>

    <para>When this item is unchecked Frhed will not save data to the registry
    when it normally does. It does this on exit and at other times - see the
    source where the function save_ini_data is called. This option was added
    so that the <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Registry</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Remove Frhed</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> item could work properly.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Change instance</title>

    <para>Allows the user to switch from one set of instance options to
    another and to specify the instance number to save to on exit and at other
    times. Note that if 2 or more instances of Frhed are open at once the
    options you save on exit may be overwritten. If you enter a non-existent
    instance number that instance will be written to the registry with current
    values and current values will stay the same. This option is always
    enabled so that you may reload instance options at any time.</para>
