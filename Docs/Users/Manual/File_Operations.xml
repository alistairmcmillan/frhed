  <section>
    <title>Creating new files</title>

    <para>Frhed starts with a new, empty file that is has no name (unless
    filename is given to <xref linkend="CommandLine" />). If a file is already
    loaded, then choose <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>New</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> from the menu. If a file is already loaded and it has been
    changed, then you will be prompted if you want to save the changes to the
    current file.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Opening files</title>

    <para>Files can be opened to Frhed in many ways. The most common way to open
    a file is to choose <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> from the menu. If a file is already loaded and it has been
    changed, then you will be prompted if you want to save the changes
    first.</para>

    <para>A file can also be dragged (for instance from the Windows Explorer)
    into Frhed's window to open it. If several files are dragged, then you have
    to choose which one to open.</para>

    <para>Frhed remembers last opened files and shows them in File-menu's Most
    Recently Used -list (MRU). File can be opened by selecting it from the
    list.</para>

    <para>If the file access permissions don't allow writing or open-read-only
    mode is on then read-only mode will be engaged.</para>

    <para>See also Frhed <xref lang="" linkend="CommandLine" remap="" />
    usage.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>If you put a link to frhed.exe into the "SendTo"-Folder in your
      Windows main directory then you can open any file from the Explorer with
      Frhed by choosing Frhed from the "Send To"-item in the file's context
      menu.</para>
    </tip>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Opening files partially</title>

    <para>Opening files allows to load only certain part of the file to memory.
    This allows to:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>load big files faster and edit them faster</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>load big files that would not fit to the memory (and would not be
        possible to load in normal way)</simpara>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is possible to load e.g. 100 KB of 4 GB file. 4 GB file would not
    fit to the memory and would be impossible to load otherwise. Even if the
    file would fit to the memory (e.g. 500 KB) then loading only part of it
    makes editing the file faster. </para>

    <para>To open a file partially choose the <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Open partially</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> command. First you will have to choose the file you want to
    open in a <guilabel>File Open</guilabel>-dialog. Then in <guilabel>Open
    Partially</guilabel> dialog you need to enter the offset from which the file
    will be loaded and how many bytes to load. Alternatively you can select the
    <guibutton>From end of file</guibutton>-radiobutton and the bytes are
    counted from the end of fhe file. Frhed can display the offsets relative to
    the start of the file instead of relative to the start of the loaded block.
    To enable this non-relative offset display select the <guibutton>Display
    offsets relative to start of file</guibutton>-radiobutton.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Most of the offsets in Frhed are offsets relative to start of the
      loaded block even though file view shows offesets relative to file
      begin.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Frhed will now be in partially-opened-mode, which means that whenever
    you choose the <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> command, the data will be written back to the position they
    were loaded from. This mode is indicated by a letter <guilabel>P</guilabel>
    in the window title after the file name.</para>

    <para>You can also resize the block of data you loaded and the corresponding
    section of the file will also be resized when you save the file.</para>

    <para>If the file access permissions don't allow writing or open-read-only
    mode is on then read-only mode will be engaged.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Saving files</title>

    <para>To save the current file choose <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> from the menu. If the file has never been saved before, then
    <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save as</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> will be automatically invoked.</para>

    <para><menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save as</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> saves the file with a different name.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Saving selections</title>

    <para>To save the current selection choose <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Save selection as</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> from the menu. If there is no selection then all of the file
    will be saved.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Reverting to the saved file</title>

    <para>When you have made changes to a file, want to change it back and
    cannot remember the exact bytes in the file then the <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> command will do it for you. If the file has never been saved
    then this command will revert to an untitled empty file.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Insert file</title>

    <para>The <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Insert file</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> command inserts the requested file between the current byte
    and previous one, replacing the selection if there is any.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Exporting the file as a hexdump text</title>

    <para>The <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Export as hexdump</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> command is used if you need the hexdump of the file in plain
    text form, for example if you need to insert it in a word processor
    document. You can either put the hexdump into the clipboard or into a file,
    which you will have to choose. The start line of the hexdump has to be
    specified (in hexadecimal notation without prefix), which you can find on
    the left side of the window, for example 23c or 134. You must also specify
    the end line. The values in the dialog will be initialized so that the whole
    file will be dumped, if there is nothing selected, or they will be such that
    the current selection will be dumped.</para>

    <para>Also you have the option of just outputting the hex bytes on a single
    line - just uncheck the "Export like Frhed display" check box.</para>

    <para>Also you have the option of outputting an RTF hexdump of the lines.
    The RTF is output by Frhed as follows:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>The file that was hexdumped in the document properties as the
        Title.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>A Times New Roman 20pt paragraph containing the file name of the
        file that was hexdumped.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Each line of hexdump, with the selection or current byte
        highlighted as per the display colours.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Bookmarks are both highlighted and put into the document. The
        bookmark name is that same as what you gave Frhed, unless you didn't
        give a name, in which case the name will be the offset of the bookmark
        in decimal. The document bookmarks will be in the same place as the
        caret.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>The separators are put in a single group together and are simple
        lines as per the display settings.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Limitations: the RTF output is not perfect in these ways:</para>

        <para>For the chars Microsoft Word will convert some into underscores
        (generally the control characters up to 0x20). This is only apparent in
        OEM mode since in ANSI mode Frhed translates these chars into periods
        (.).</para>

        <para>Microsoft Word will alter the bookmark names by replacing
        non-alphanumerics with underscores, place "BM" in front of bookmarks
        that begin with a number and hide bookmarks beginning with underscores
        (can still view them with "Hidden bookmarks" checked).</para>

        <para>If your display is running at anything less than 24 bit colour you
        may not get the colours you expect for the caret. This is because at
        lower bit levels the InvertRect function (which Frhed uses to invert the
        caret in the window) works differently than just inverting the bits of
        colours as it does at 24-bit &amp; as Frhed does in generating the
        inverted colour for RTF export. If someone finds out how InvertRect
        works at lower bit levels please let me (Pabs) know.</para>

        <para>The bookmarks border takes up space (at least on Word2000) which
        means that subsequent characters on the same line will be displaced to
        the right 2 pixels. This is noticable when there is a selection covering
        two adjacent lines, one with &amp; one without a bookmark. There is
        little that can be done about this except try a different word
        processor.</para>

        <para>The separators will not always be sized or positioned exactly.
        There is not much that can be done about this since it is hard to know
        the exact size in twips the word processor will display the text at. An
        alternative to this might be to use tables, which might not work and
        might also solve the bookmark problem.</para>

        <para>At some fonts &amp; sizes (esp. OEM &amp; ANSI 9, ANSI 10) Frhed
        cannot determine the correct font name the system chose &amp; this will
        cause Word to use the wrong font, often this will be Times New Roman.
        This may or may not be true depending on whether or not the font mapper
        for your system uses one font for all sizes and the fonts you have
        installed. Unfortunately Word ignores the other font hints that can be
        determined; character set, variable/monospaced and font family.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <section>
    <title>Deleting the current file</title>

    <para>The <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Delete File</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> command deletes the file currently opened in the editor and
    closes it. This requires a double confirmation because it could be
    disastrous.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>USE WITH CAUTION! When ever you edit files using any hex editor you
      should <emphasis role="bold">always</emphasis> have a backup
      anyway.</para>
    </warning>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Importing a hexdump file</title>

    <para>The <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Import from hexdump</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> command imports hexdump data from the clipboard or from a
    file.</para>

    <para>The data you choose to import can be in one of two formats. One is a
    text version of the display &amp; the other is all the hex digits on one
    line.</para>

    <para>The Frhed will try to determine the type by looking for characters
    that are not whitespace or hexdigits and you will be asked to verify the
    Frhed's findings.</para>

    <para>If you decide it is in the Frhed display format then you will be asked
    if you want the display settings found in the file to replace current ones.
    If so, Frhed can determine the offset length, the number of bytes per line,
    if the offset length should be automatically adjusted and possibly if the
    data is ANSI/OEM from its contents. If any of these cannot be determined
    their settings will remain the same.</para>

    <para>Frhed will also notify you if the character and hex data do not agree
    with each other or the offsets are invalid and you may choose to ignore any
    more of these notices.</para>

    <para>If illegal characters are found in the hexdata section or the data
    ends unexpectedly the operation will not be able to continue and you will
    have the option of keeping the data that has already been found or
    cancelling the operation.</para>

    <para>Also if the first offset found is not zero you can insert that amount
    of null bytes at the start of the file and if you choose not to and you
    chose to alter relevant display settings then Frhed will display offsets
    relative to the first offset found.</para>

    <para>If you decide it is not in the Frhed display format then Frhed will go
    through the file filtering out whitespace and adding each hex digit found as
    a nibble (If odd no's of hex digits are present then '0' will be the last
    nibble). If other characters are found Frhed will complain and give you the
    option of ignoring the any other illegal characters that are found.</para>

    <para>If the file access permissions don't allow writing or open-read-only
    mode is on then read-only mode will be engaged.</para>

    <para>If the current file has been changed, then you will be prompted if you
    want to lose the changes, save the changes or cancel the request.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>If the file was output using an offset length that is smaller than
      is required the parser will determine that the character data does not
      match the hex data. If the output data is edited to the same as with an
      offset length of 2 the same thing happens. This occurs because of a bug in
      <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu>

          <guimenuitem>Export as Hexdump</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>, causing it to remove characters from the end of each line
      that has larger offset lengths than that of the first line. This bug was
      fixed in v1.0.156.Pabs. If you know the file was output using a small
      offset length and are sure that you have not edited it press Yes to ignore
      any further mismatches, no to ignore that one or cancel to cancel the
      Import operation. Ignoring the mismatches will have no effect.</para>
