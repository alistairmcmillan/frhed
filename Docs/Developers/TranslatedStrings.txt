Using translated string from resource
-------------------------------------
$Id$

This document explains how to use translated strings in the code. All
translated strings in Frhed must be in resource file (FRHED/heksedit.rc). Our
translation system reads strings from there and generates POT/PO files that
translators can translate.

There is a helper class LangString that takes care of getting the string by
resource ID.

To add a new translated string:

1. Add a new string ID to the FRHED/resource.h file. Use IDS_ -prefix:
#define IDS_OPEN_ALL_FILES              10003

2. Add the string to FRHED/heksedit.rc file:
    IDS_OPEN_ALL_FILES      "All Files (*.*)\0*.*\0\0"

3. Add this same ID to the FRHED/StringTable.inl:
DECLARE(IDS_OPEN_ALL_FILES)

5. Add includes to the .cpp file where you are using the string:
#include "LangString.h"

6. Create LangString instance from the string:
	LangString openAllFiles(IDS_OPEN_ALL_FILES);

7. Use the LangString instance in place of the original string:
	ofn.lpstrFilter = openAllFiles;
