Frhed version numbers are managed by the versions.ini file and
Tools/SetVersions.py script. When the script is run it sets version numbers
for all resources listed in the ini file.

SetVersions.py script usage:

!!! This script is work in progress !!!

The SetVersions.py script sets versions numbers in different components.
Components and version numbers to set are defined in configuration file. The
configuration file is Windows INI-file kind of file, with sections and values.

The section name is only descriptive for the resource to process. It gets
printed by the script when running.

All sections have these values:
- type
  Resource type to set
- description
  Short description of the resource (e.g. Installer) to set version
- path
  Relative path to the resource to process
- version
  Version string/number to set

Available types are:
CS-AssemblyInfo:
  Set version number to C# AssemblyInfo file. The script searches for line
  having assembly: AssemblyVersion -text and sets the version number.

InnoSetup:
  Set version number to InnoSetup installer script. The installer script
  must have preprocessor define for the version number. The script replaces
  value of this macro.

NSIS: 
  Set version number to NSIS installer script. The installer script must have
  version defined with PRODUCT_VERSION -macro. For example:
  !define PRODUCT_VERSION "1.2.3"

WinRC:
  Set file- and product-version into the Windows RC file. The script searches
  for version numbers in version resource. The script also makes sure that
  numeric version number has always four numbers. If less numbers are given,
  zeros are added to the end.

For example:
[Installer]
type = NSIS
description = ChecksumTool NSIS Installer
path = Installer/NSIS/CheckSumTool.nsi
version = "0.6.0"

[Installer]
type = InnoSetup
description = WinMerge InnoSetup installer
path = Installer/InnoSetup/WinMerge.iss
macro = AppVersion
version = "2.9.12"
