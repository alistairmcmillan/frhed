# VS versions. This script calls VS binary to upgrade every file listed. If the
# file is solution file, then all projects in the solution are also upgraded.

# http://www.devsource.com/c/a/Using-VS/Working-at-the-Visual-Studio-Command-Line/1/

# This script originates from WinMerge project (http://winmerge.org)
